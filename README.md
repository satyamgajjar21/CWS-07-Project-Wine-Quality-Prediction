## Wine Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using machine learning techniques. The model learns from physicochemical properties of wine and predicts quality scores based on these attributes.

## Problem Statement
Wine quality assessment is traditionally performed by human experts, which is subjective and time consuming. This project aims to automate wine quality prediction using machine learning models based on measurable chemical features.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains multiple physicochemical properties of wine samples such as acidity, sugar content, pH, and alcohol level. Each sample is labeled with a quality score representing overall wine quality.

## Technologies Used
Python  
Jupyter Notebook  
Pandas  
NumPy  
Matplotlib  
Seaborn  
Scikit learn  

## Project Workflow
Data loading and exploration  
Data visualization and analysis  
Data preprocessing  
Feature selection  
Model training  
Model evaluation  

## Data Analysis and Visualization
Exploratory data analysis is performed to understand feature distributions, correlations, and their impact on wine quality using statistical plots and heatmaps.

## Feature Engineering
Relevant features are selected and scaled where required to improve model performance and learning efficiency.

## Machine Learning Models
Linear Regression  
Decision Tree  
Random Forest  
Support Vector Machine  

## Model Training
The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Multiple models are trained to compare performance and determine the most effective predictor for wine quality.

## Model Evaluation
Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, mean squared error, and R squared score to measure prediction reliability.

## Results
The machine learning models demonstrate the ability to predict wine quality with reasonable accuracy based on chemical properties, with ensemble models showing stronger performance.
